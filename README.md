# Coursera-Python-Capstone-Project Summary:
For this capstone project, I accomplished the following key tasks:

# 1.Data Collection using SpaceX API:
I utilized the SpaceX API to collect relevant data for my project. This could include information about launches, payloads, launch sites, or other details related to SpaceX missions.


# 2.Data Collection with Web Scraping:
In addition to the SpaceX API, I performed web scraping to gather data from websites. This involved extracting information that wasn't available through the API or obtaining complementary data from different sources.


# 3.Data Wrangling:
I engaged in data wrangling, a crucial step in preparing and cleaning the collected data. This process included handling missing values, formatting issues, and transforming the data to make it suitable for analysis.


# 4.Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using SQL:
Leveraging SQL, I conducted exploratory data analysis to gain insights into the structure and content of my dataset. This involved querying the database, aggregating statistics, and exploring relationships between variables.


# 5.EDA Data Visualization using Python (Pandas and Matplotlib):
I employed Python libraries such as Pandas and Matplotlib to create visualizations that enhance my understanding of the data. Visualizations included histograms, scatter plots, and other charts to highlight patterns or trends.


# 6.Interactive Visual Analytics with Folium:
Using Folium, a Python library for interactive mapping, I performed visual analytics on geographical data related to SpaceX missions. This involved mapping launch sites, success rates, or other relevant information.


# 7.Analysis with Plotly Dash:
I utilized Plotly Dash, a framework for building interactive web applications with Python, to perform in-depth analysis and potentially create interactive dashboards. This involved developing visualizations and interactive features for deeper exploration of the data.


# 8.Machine Learning Landing Prediction of SpaceX:
In the final phase of my project, I applied machine learning techniques to predict the landing outcome of SpaceX missions. This involved training a model on historical data to make predictions about whether a given mission will result in a successful or unsuccessful landing.


This comprehensive project demonstrates my proficiency in data collection, cleaning, analysis, and visualization, as well as the application of machine learning techniques to solve a specific problem within the context of SpaceX missions.
